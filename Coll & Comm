For my friends Coll & Comm:

What is learning, one may ask! It’s the task of thinking, not too slow, nor too fast!

It’s not about cramming or jamming what you've learned. 
Diffused or focused, this is not hocus pocus, both have merit and in the end your brain will inherit.

I like ‘chunking’ as it’s easy to do , the common relationship of my memory, yes me & you!
It’s a long journey from beginning to end, but for short & long memories, it’s worth the time we spend. Transfer the info, from the front to the back, building that memory while keeping us on track.

Practice makes perfect or so they say, my willingness to try, will keep the ‘Zombies’ at bay. Don't freak out and let the ‘negs’ get in the way! Join the connections from front to back, the lobs will love it and surely interact. 

Don’t overthink it, as this you will hate, the illusions of learning is just a temporary state. Sure you've learned it and know all your ‘stuff’, now is the time to recall the plan and check that it’s enough.

Open your eyes and visualise, your spatial skills will have something to say. It’s an exercise we can all do. When you relate to the image, your brain will too.

Procrastination will make you late, it will affect your diary and leave you in a state. Don’t put off until tomorrow, what you can do today, embrace the task and ‘chunk’ it. Learning is here to stay!

Adopt the cue, routine, reward and belief. Yea, we can remember these, they add to our learning relief. And an hour spent a day will be worth the pain, as our brian will remember, as we’ve learned it this way. 

You are the subject expert, and this you can recall, what has been written, spoken and all! 
The gain is not in vain, and in the end, your brian is your very own personal friend!
